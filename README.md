#### How to Play
The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate, placing X's and O's on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.
Each box of the following tic-tak-toe board is represented by a number from 1 to 9. Players can mark the box by using the command `~fill (grid_number)`.

### Car Race

Luck is all you need.

#### How to Play
Finish this race of luck by rolling the dice having numbers 1 to 4 alternatively. One who takes less number of rolls wins the race. If both took the same number of rolls then its a draw.
Use the `~drive` command alternatively to roll the dice and move the car.

### Ludo
Use `~miniLudo` command to play this game.
Luck with scratching your head.

#### How to Play
Major rules are the same as Ludo but few changes. Each player has two ludo pieces. One will get an extra roll of dice only if he rolls 6. He won't be given a second roll for making one of his pieces reach its destination or for cutting another's piece. You can coincide both pieces on a single spot but remember if someone came to the spot both of your pieces have to start again.
Use the command `~roll` alternatively to roll the dice and to move the desired piece use the command `~move (1 or 2 depending upon choice)`. If you forgot your pieces use the command `~pieces`.

### Guess The Word
Use  `~wordgusser` to play this game.
Scratch your head till you get it.

#### How to Play
Rules are the same as hangsman. Guess the word within specific chances. All the vowels are already marked. You have to guess all the consonants present in the word.
Use command `~guess (the letter)` to guess a consonant
